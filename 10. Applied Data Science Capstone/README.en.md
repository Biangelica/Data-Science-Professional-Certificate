SpaceX revolutionized the space industry by offering Falcon 9 rocket launches for as low as $62 million, significantly undercutting competitors whose prices exceed $165 million. The key to these savings lies in SpaceX's groundbreaking practice of reusing the first stage, landed and refurbished for subsequent missions. As a data scientist at a startup challenging SpaceX, my project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline predicting the first stage's landing outcome. This initiative is essential for strategically bidding against SpaceX for rocket launches at the optimal price.
